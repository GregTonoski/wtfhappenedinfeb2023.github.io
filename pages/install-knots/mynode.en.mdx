## Mynode steps

Mynode does not yet support Knots, so in the meantime you can use ordisrespector to limit spam.

You must have at least version [v0.3.10](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode/blob/776ccb35d1939b76de429dd129247425cd911f17/CHANGELOG#L4)

1. Connect to your mynode
2. Go to settings
3. Click on `Show upgrade logs`
4. Go down to custom bitcoin version
5. Selection ordisrespector with the desired version
6. Click on install

And there you go, you now have ordisrespector on your node.
